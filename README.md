<div align="justify"> 
This repository hosts the codebase responsible for the reaction wheel system utilized in the Starscout rocket, developed by Endeavour Rocketry Society, based in Edinburgh.
  
***

Utilizing a PID controller and leveraging data from the attached BNO055 IMU, the system precisely regulates the speed of the reaction wheel's motor, thereby stabilizing the rocket's rotational motion. 
* To run the code with data logging, simply upload the 'main_data_logging.ino' file to the Arduino Nano, following the electrical diagram as specified in the figure below.
* For those who desire a more streamlined version of the code without data logging functionality, the procedure is equally simple: disconnect the SD card reader from the Arduino, and then upload the 'main.ino' file.
